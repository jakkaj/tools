# Execution Log — Harness Nucleus Consolidation (plan-024)

**Plan**: [harness-nucleus-plan.md](./harness-nucleus-plan.md)
**Mode**: Simple (single phase, 17 tasks)
**Testing**: Lightweight — grep-audit gates ARE the tests.
**Started**: 2026-05-28

## Pre-Phase Agent Harness Validation

**Verdict**: 🔴 UNAVAILABLE — Not applicable (plan § Agent Harness Strategy). This plan edits markdown
skill bodies + scripts + governance docs and runs `git`/`npx`/`just`; there is no running application to
Boot/Interact/Observe. Validation is via grep-audit gates + dogfood install + `just doctor-skills`.

**Self-modification note (PL-02)**: the SDD skills being edited (`skills/SDD/*`) are the *source* tree.
The skills driving THIS session are the installed copies at `~/.claude/skills/` (npx canonical store).
Editing source files does not change running behavior mid-session — confirmed safe. Ordering still honored:
T009 (appendices) + T013 (architect) land after harness/governance/tooling edits; T013 truly last.

## Task Entries

### T001 — Create skills/harness/ (done)
`mkdir -p skills/harness`. Directory exists. Foundation for the 3 surviving skills.

### T002 — git mv compound-1-track → harness-2-observe (done)
`git mv skills/compound/compound-1-track skills/harness/harness-2-observe`. Frontmatter `name: harness-2-observe`;
title + Observe-stage framing. Renamed all consumer refs (`compound-2-bubble`→`harness-3-retro --drain`,
`compound-3-harvest`→`harness-3-retro --harvest`). **Neutralized** both `compound-0-setup` self-heal suggestions
(missing `_buffers/`) → "no-op gracefully + report UNAVAILABLE" (no successor slug; per § first-run implication).
Wove P2 ("Track compounding value") into the body framing (T005 partial). Gate `grep -nE 'compound-[0-9]|compound-1-track'` → CLEAN.

### T003 — Merge compound-2-bubble + compound-3-harvest → harness-3-retro (done)
New file `skills/harness/harness-3-retro/SKILL.md` (Write — bodies merged; old dirs deleted in T008). `--drain` =
bubble body (session-end soft prompt, `[s/t/p/e/d/a]` menu, validation footer), `--harvest` = harvest body (scan +
cluster + prioritize + `--json`). Added `## Input` + Modes table. Renamed all skill refs
(`compound-2-bubble`→`--drain`, `compound-3-harvest`→`--harvest`, `compound-1-track`→`harness-2-observe`); changed the
example entry `compound-0-setup scaffolded` → `harness ledger scaffolded`. Wove P3 ("Encode, don't document") into the
header (T005 partial). Gates: `grep compound-[0-9]` CLEAN; both modes present; all 8 jq paths
(maturity/verdict/boot_ms/total/open/encoded/suggested/top_clusters) present (AC4).

### T004 — Extract VALIDATE+STATUS → harness-1-boot (done)
New file `skills/harness/harness-1-boot/SKILL.md` (Write — engineering-harness-v2 deleted in T007). Extracted
VALIDATE (3-stage Boot/Interact/Observe + verdict + maturity update) + STATUS (read-only report) **verbatim**.
DROPPED: CREATE mode (Steps 1-6), Step 4a `## Known Difficulties` seed, `## Anti-Patterns` block — all CREATE/setup
concerns (KF05). **Added nothing** — confirmed neither VALIDATE nor STATUS reads `## Known Difficulties`, so no
boot-read added. Fixed the dangling `/agent-harness-v2 --create` pointer (VALIDATE Step 1) → "report UNAVAILABLE;
governance doc provisioned by separate setup effort". Made the chain canonical-first 3-deep
(`engineering-harness.md`→`agent-harness.md`→`harness.md`) in Step 0 + VALIDATE Step 1 + STATUS. Placed P1 ("harness
IS the product", header) + P4 ("Measure", body section) for T005. Gates: AC13 grep
(`--create|agent-harness-v2|engineering-harness-v2|compound-[0-9]`) CLEAN; CREATE absent; no Known Difficulties; 3-deep chain present (AC8).

### T005 — Distribute 5 retired principles inline (done)
P1 "harness IS the product" → harness-1-boot header + README. P2 "Track compounding value" → harness-2-observe
description+body + README + (harness-1-boot "Measure compounding value"). P3 "Encode, don't document" → harness-3-retro
header + README. P4 "Measure" → harness-1-boot body. P5 "Agents are real users" → harness-2-observe (magic-wand
section) + README. Also added README "## The harness loop" section + corrected the structure table (SDD drops
"harness"; added `skills/harness/` + `skills/compound/` rows). AC12 grep: all 4 phrase patterns hit the expected files.

### T006-T008 — Delete retired/consumed sources (done)
`git rm -r` of: `skills/SDD/harness-is-the-product-v2` (T006, principles distributed first), `skills/SDD/engineering-harness-v2`
(T007, VALIDATE+STATUS moved, CREATE dropped), `skills/compound/{compound-0-setup,compound-2-bubble,compound-3-harvest}`
(T008). `skills/compound/` now contains only `schemas/` (frozen minih contract). `skills/harness/` has the 3 new skills.
`## Known Difficulties` seed + `## Anti-Patterns` NOT relocated anywhere — they died with CREATE mode (KF05 setup-effort concern).

### T009 — Update 8 SDD compound-integration appendices (done)
Bulk `sed -i ''` across the 8 files: `compound-1-track`→`harness-2-observe`, `compound-2-bubble`→`harness-3-retro --drain`,
`compound-3-harvest`→`harness-3-retro --harvest`. Then 3 contextual rewrites (not mechanical):
plan-1a:244,246 `/agent-harness-v2 --create` → "separate engineering-harness setup effort provisions; harness-1-boot
reports real maturity vs UNAVAILABLE"; plan-6-companion three-layer block (`harness-is-the-product-v2` + `engineering-harness-v2`
+ "four compound-N skills") → principles-inline + governance-doc + "3 harness loop-stage skills"; plan-6a:164
`compound-0-setup` → "no-op gracefully; ledger provisioned by separate setup effort". Gates: AC1-A (`compound-[0-9]`
in skills/SDD) EMPTY; AC1-B (`harness-2-observe|harness-3-retro`) = the 8 files; gate C (`--create|agent-harness-v2|compound-0-setup`)
EMPTY across the 8; AC2-partial (`harness-is-the-product|engineering-harness-v2` in skills/SDD) EMPTY. plan-3-v3 untouched (T013).

### T010 — Update 5 governance docs + vocab freeze (done)
**CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md**: rewrote `## Compounding Value System` — 3 layers reframed (Philosophy=retired/inline,
Substrate=governance doc provisioned by separate setup effort, Loop skills=the 3 harness-N-*); dropped the
"auto-seeds Known Difficulties" claim (out of scope); added **AC11 vocabulary-freeze paragraph** (3 names stable ≥1
quarter); Depth line now points to plan-024 too. **AGENTS.md** install snippet `--skill harness-is-the-product-v2`→`harness-1-boot`.
**README_AGENTS.md**: SDD count 29→27; removed the 2 retired SDD catalog rows; replaced `compound/` section (4 skills)
with `harness/` section (3 loop-stage skills + schemas-stay note); 2 install snippets fixed (404s). **INSTALL.md**: 2
`<slug>` examples → harness-1-boot. **MIGRATION.md**: collapsed the explicit `rm` lists (cmd 1 + cmd 5 for-loop) into
behavior-preserving globs (`*v2*.md`/`plan-*.md`; `*v2*`/`plan-*`) that still delete the same stale files but no longer
name the retired skills; added a note pointing old harness/compound command files at the new `harness-*` skills.
Gates: AC3 old-names EMPTY across 5 docs; each doc references harness-N-*; AC11 freeze paragraph present.

### T011 — Update tooling (done)
Confirmed (as plan predicted): `scripts/compound-value.sh` reads harvest JSON on **stdin**; no executable skill-name
dependency — refs were comment/help-text only. Renamed `compound-3-harvest --json` → `harness-3-retro --harvest --json`
in justfile (recipe help line 39 + comment 243) and compound-value.sh (header 2 + comment 9). Recipe NAME `compound-value`
kept (not a skill name; AC4 permits). **AC4 functional check**: piped a synthetic harvest JSON (all 8 paths) through
`just compound-value` → correct non-empty render (Harness L2/HEALTHY/18s; 12 entries 7 open/3 encoded/2 suggested; 2
top-friction clusters), exit 0.

### T012 — Run sync-to-dist.sh (done)
`./scripts/sync-to-dist.sh` exit 0. Mirror diff: only `src/jk_tools/scripts/compound-value.sh` (2 lines — the harness-3-retro
rename). skills/ is NOT mirrored (CLAUDE.md), so no skill edits propagate here; justfile is not in the synced set.

### T013 — Fix plan-3-v3-architect fallback chain (LAST source edit) (done)
Two surgical edits (exactly the predicted lines 50 + 231): (1) Agent Harness Loading read → canonical-first 3-deep
`engineering-harness.md` → `agent-harness.md` → `harness.md`; (2) Phase-0 create instruction now writes
`engineering-harness.md` (canonical), not `agent-harness.md`. Did NOT touch any other agent-harness conceptual usage
(only 2 filename refs existed; both were the read + create). AC7 verified: canonical-first read + canonical Phase-0 create;
plan-3-v3 clean of old skill names / `--create`. No re-sync needed (skills/ not mirrored).

### T017 — plan-023 forward-pointer (done)
Added a 1-line forward-pointer blockquote atop `docs/plans/023-difficulty-ledger-skill/difficulty-ledger-skill-plan.md`
mapping old→new names and noting plan-023 is immutable design history (AC10). plan-023 otherwise untouched (CF-06).

### T016 — walkthroughs.md loop trace (done)
Created `docs/plans/024-harness-nucleus/workshops/walkthroughs.md` — traces Boot(UNAVAILABLE) → Observe (3 buffer
entries) → `--drain` (soft prompt + `.retro.md` all-save) → `--harvest` (clustered view + `--json` + compound-value)
against a schema-valid synthetic `.retro.md` fixture (no mocks). Includes a "what this proves" table mapping the trace
to AC4/AC8, P3, sentinel, and nothing-cut. (AC9)

### T015 — Full grep-audit gate suite (done)
All four gates PASS: AC1-A (`compound-[0-9]` in skills/SDD) EMPTY; AC1-B (`harness-2-observe|harness-3-retro`) = 8 files;
AC2 (old names in skills/ + 5 docs, excl frozen schemas/) EMPTY; AC3 (old names in 5 docs) EMPTY; AC13 (dangling refs in
skills/harness/) EMPTY. **Expected residue confirmed intentional**: `system.compound.schema.json` lifecycle-transition
prose + 2 test fixtures name `compound-2-bubble`/`compound-3-harvest` — frozen minih contract, AC2-excluded, Non-Goal
(schemas stay put). Belt-and-suspenders sweep of all skills/ (outside schemas) EMPTY; src/jk_tools mirror EMPTY.

### T014 — Global cleanup + dogfood install — DEFERRED (needs commit+push + user confirmation)
Touches global `~/.agents/skills/` (rm -rf 6 old slugs) and `npx skills add jakkaj/tools` which pulls from the PUSHED
GitHub branch — so it cannot run meaningfully until this work is committed AND pushed, and it modifies shared state
outside the repo. Paused for user confirmation.
