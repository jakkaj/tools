# Workflow Stage Execution

You are executing a workflow stage. Read the bootstrap instructions and follow them exactly.

**Start here**: `{{PROMPT_PATH}}`

Read that file and follow its instructions. The file will guide you through:
1. Running preflight to validate inputs
2. Reading the stage configuration
3. Reading your inputs
4. Executing the stage work
5. Validating your outputs

Do not deviate from the workflow instructions. Complete each step before moving to the next.
