# Task Completion Checklist
- Rerun `./setup.sh` (or targeted installer script) to validate new or modified setup logic executes without errors.
- Spot-check generated artifacts (e.g., copied command markdown, MCP config files) for expected paths and contents.
- Ensure new tools include comprehensive `--help` output and document dependencies within the repo.
- Keep temporary experiments inside `scratch/` and leave tracked directories clean before finalizing changes.
